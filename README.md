- 👋 Hi, I’m @MannyVenegas, I studied economics, but I really didn't enjoy it. I later found my passion for coding. I think the ability to create and make your own ideas happen, is far  more valuable that any other thing you can learn.
- 👀 I’m interested in WEBDEV/Databases.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any OpenSource project where I can practice my code and become a better coder.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can always contact me here, my Twitter @manu_vem or my LinkedIn profile linkedin.com/in/manuvenegas.
