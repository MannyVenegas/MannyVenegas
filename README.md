- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MannyVenegas, I studied economics. I later found my passion for coding and data. I think the ability to create and make your own ideas happen, is far  more valuable that any other thing you can learn.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data analysis.
- ğŸŒ± I know Python, R and JS. .
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: you can always contact me here, my Twitter @manu_vem or my LinkedIn profile linkedin.com/in/manuvenegas.
